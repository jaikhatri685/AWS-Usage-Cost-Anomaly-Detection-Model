# AWS-Usage-Cost-Anomaly-Detection-Model
As a part of Internship at Swiggy, Worked on AWS Usage Cost Anomaly Detection Model. The purpose of the project was to create a program capable of identifying anomalies in the usage cost of Amazon Web Services by the company. The company uses AWS services such as E2-instance, Relational DataBase Service etc to host applications, for data management, computing and storage management. The daily cost incurred by the company is in thousands of dollar($). Any anomalies such as misues of server or ineffective utilisation of these services will add another few thousands of dollar to the usage cost of the AWS services. This leads to additional cost incurred, cutting on the profit of the company. This creates the need for the development of program that automate the detection of such anomalies.

** To maintain the privacy of the company's cost data, dummy aws cost data has been used for the purpose of displaying the project.
